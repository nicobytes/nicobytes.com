Duety was a mobile app that gave points for every good deed that a couple did for each other. I contributed to creating a customized experience for users with a native app available for Android and iOS. I used Ionic Framework, Cordova, and Angular in frontend.

### Challenging UX/UI

This app was created for couples and designed with a custom UI to engage the users. This part was challenging because I created a lot of custom UIs with reusable components across the app.

### Challenging UX/UI

Within the app, there were a lot of activities for couples, with a lot of sections to do and ask something. In this part, I created reusable cards and used [Angular Reactive Forms](https://angular.dev/guide/forms/form-validation#validating-input-in-reactive-forms) to control all input validations in the app.

### The stack

The app was built with <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a>, Cordova, and Angular, and used a lot of custom sytles using Sass.
