This app was divided in two parts the website to capture new leads and a dashboard to handle the whole process to renting a property.

### Responsive website

The website was built with <a href="https://angular.dev" target="_blank">Angular</a> and <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a> to create a fast and responsive website. When a new lead showed interest in a property, an event was triggered in the dashboard for sellers to get in contact with this customer.

### Kanban board

The dashboard was built with Angular and Ionic to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board" target="_blank">Kanban board</a> to manage the properties and the process of renting or selling them. This board was divided into customs columns, representing the process of renting a property, and the properties were represented as cards. This dashboard is only allowed for specific roles through a system of authorization for admins and sellers of the company.

### Properties Hub

As part of the dashboard, there was a properties hub with a lot of filters to show the properties and information about them. The backend was created using Flask and Python with a REST API, and I used <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/" target="_blank">Couchbase</a>,Â a NoSQL database that allows me to store a lot of data.
